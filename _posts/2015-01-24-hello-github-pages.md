My new blog seems to be working!

I created it in **Github Pages** using [this awesome guide from Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/), forking from the [Hyde theme](https://github.com/poole/hyde) and editing files with [Prose](http://prose.io). What's great about this platform is that your blog becomes a purely static site, with no server-side code, no database and (I hope) no problems at all. Just write Markdown, play a little with theme configuration and the site gets compiled and published automagically.

If you can read this, then all this stuff is easy enough even for me to use just by glancing at the documentation for ten minutes while typing random stuff in the command line. :) Two thumbs up!
