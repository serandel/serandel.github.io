R+D team leader at [Linea Directa](http://www.lineadirecta.com). While making our mobile apps, I've fallen in love with Android openness, so now I develop personal projects, and the ocassional contractor work, in my free time.

This blog is my way of giving back to the community a tiny fraction of all the help I've received.

## Setup

How have I managed to make this blog? 

* Inspired and guided by [an article from Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/). Great site!
* Generated as a static site with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Edited with [Prose](http://prose.io), so I don't even need to go away from the browser for that 
* *Roboto* and *Roboto Slab* fonts from [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts), like half the web
* Used these awesome [SVG Social Icons](https://github.com/neilorangepeel/Free-Social-Icons)

Thanks for reading!
